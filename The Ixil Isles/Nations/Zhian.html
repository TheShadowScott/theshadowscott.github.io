            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                The last great holdout of <em>Diabolus,</em> Zhi was founded on the blood of heretics expelled by the first Purges. Zhi is often found
                on the end of international wars, on both offensive and defensive fronts. Although technically no crimes exists within Zhi,
                those who are suspected of treason or mutiny are often found dead or missing. The military of Zhi consists of large assassination bands,
                in addition to its standard military.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                The ruling party of Zhi, the Kel'Zhian, is a council of 3 high priest, each representing a different aspect of Diabolus (i.e,
                <em>Death</em>, <em>Destruction</em> and <em>Deceit</em>). These high priest are selected by a variety of cruel competitions led by
                the thorned crown, an ambassador of Diablous himself (although it is still unknown why Diabolus would need an ambassador, and why 
                said ambassador is not on the Kel'Zhian).

                Zhi is represented by the devil in the game of cards.
