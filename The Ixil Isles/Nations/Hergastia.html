            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                Hergastia is a coalition between Elves and Humans originally founded by the Elves as the <em>Sylvan Kingdom</em> on the 2nd Harvest,
                on the 20th year of the Second Age of man, QK. The nation was founded in response to the <em>Great Sylvan wars</em>, which took place in the
                first Age of Man. The Kingdom opened its doors to humans during the Grand Inquisition, during which the nation was renamed to Hergastia.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                During the Enlightenment, a coup revolution by a joint coalition of humans and elves overthrew the monarchy, and established a republic in its place, although this
                was only popular in the west, and the east split into the country of Valos.
                Typically the heads of state (the president and the prime minister) are split between elves and humans, although the current human prime minister is vacant,
                as they met their untimely demise by a Zhian assassin, which has led to a political crisis and escalating tensions between the two nations.
