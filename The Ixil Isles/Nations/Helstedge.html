            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                All worlds have their creation, and for Ixil that creation is Helstedge. The nation was founded by the "first king",
                who is today considered to be a conqueror of several smaller tribes. The foundation of Helstedge is the marker for the beginner
                of the Sub-umbral Age, and the first year of the Sub-umbral Age is considered to be the first year of "recorded" Ixil history
                (other history is recorded, but to a significantly smaller extent).
            </p>
            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                Throughout the Enlightenment and regrowth, Helstedge transformed from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy, with a majority of the crown's
                power being transferred to the high council (itself consisting of the House of Lords and the senate). The monarch is still the head of state, but
                the monarch's power is limited by the constitution.
