            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                One of many nations to have split from Helstedge, the Kingdom of Setting has become a powerful player in its own right with the worlds strongest functioning navy.
                With that navy, Setting also has the worlds largest merchant fleet, and boasts the largest maritime economy.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                The name "Kingdom" in Settings name is misleading, as the nation is a republic. The name is a relic from the nations founding, when the nation was a monarchy,
                formerly headed by the Archduke of Setting (the viceroy of Helstedge). The nations splitting gave rise to the name of the Setting age, which followed shortly
                after this nations founding.
