            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                The nation of Ghol was declared as a faithful haven by King Alford II of Azuria on 3rd 13., 2nd year of the 1st Age of Man, QK. The nation was declared as
                an independent <em>see</em> on 2nd Frost, 12th year of the 2nd Age of Man, QK. The national church of Ghol (The Western Holy See) split from the Azurian
                Eastern See during the Red Wars. Prior to the split, the King was appointed by the Head of the Church of Glory, however, post-split, the King (now God-King)
                is elected by the <em>Council of the Faithful</em>, a group of 21 elders overseeing the Western See. Although not technically required, the God-King is
                always appointed from the council.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                Ghol is one of two countries with a mandated national religion, although the enforcement of such laws have laxened in recent years.
                When it is enforced, the punishment recently only carries a fine (typically not exceeding 100 GP) and renouncement. However, death is
                still the listed punishment for heresy, and has been used twice in the last 50 years against members of <em>diabolus.</em>
