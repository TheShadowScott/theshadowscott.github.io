            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                All worlds have their industrial centre, and for Ixil that centre is Craftland. Originally a founded (and conquered) as an administrative
                region of the Elydian Empire, Craftland secured independence in the Second Purges by the treaty of Cleoreton. The nation has since rose to
                prominence, and is the most recently founded nation to be awarded a major arcana card in the game of cards.

            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                The wealthy upper class are in control of much of the nations politics, which is often seen as a tax haven for outside interests.
                Prior to the ratification of the <em>Treaty of one's rights</em>, labour laws were non-existent, and the nation was a known for sweatshops.
                The treaty has helped reduce the number of sweatshops, but the nation is still known for its low wages and long hours, and in some places
                it is suspected that slavery is still practiced, in disregard of the treaty.
