                The sprawling mountains of Che are home to numerous and vast clans of dwarves, each with their own unique culture and history.
                The clans have been in a state of near-constant war for centuries, and the only thing that has kept them from destroying each other is the
                threat of humanity. The Chean Empire was formed in response to the second <em>War of Blood</em>, which took place in the First Age of Man
                as a means to unite the clans and protect themselves from the humans.

            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                During the Inquisition, the human nation of <em>Nashruzju</em> split from the Chean Empire, which entirely encircles it. During the
                Torchwood era, Che conceded additional land in its internals to <em>Aj'ji</em>, a nation of Tabaxi, in exchange for their support in the
                game of cards.
