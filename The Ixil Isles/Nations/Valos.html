                Unimpressed by the democratic reforms of the Enlightenment, the eastern consulate of then-Hergastia succeeded from the republic
                under its limited time succession-by-referendum clause. However quickly after the succession, Valos fell into disarray, and was quickly
                seized by the <em>Dix dynasty.</em> During this period, all humans were forcefully expelled from the country, and access into its borders
                was heavily restricted.

                Despite the long lifetime of elves, the turnover rate for the throne is frequent, and the current ruler, Empereur Dix CCLXVII, is the 267th
                ruler of the dynasty, for an average reign of just over nine years. The emperors are often assassinated and poisoned by others in line of the throne,
                and the blood line has been diluted to the point where the next in line is often a distant cousin.
