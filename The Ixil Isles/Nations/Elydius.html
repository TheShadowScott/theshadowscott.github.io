            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                The Elydian Empire is often called the "bastion of light" due to its long-standing tradition of being a beacon of hope and freedom in the Ixil Isles.
                The empire was founded by Lord-on-high Sigmund I who split the nation from the neighboring nation of Helstedge in the 3rd year of the Penumbral Age.
                The Empire has since absorbed several smaller surrounding nations, and is the second largest nation in landmass, second to the Duchy of Imzola.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                The Elydian Empire is a meritocracy, and as such, the head of state is the Lord Chancellor, who is elected by the board of trustees of the
                Chancellor's College. The Chancellor's College is a prestigious institution of higher learning, and is one of two institutions in the Ixil Isles that
                offers arcane study. The Chancellor's College is known for the production of "white" mages, and does not, by charter, teach evocation or necromancy.
