            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                Whilst Azuria is known for its production of white mages, Imzola is known for its (sometimes infamous) Deftol college, the worlds most prestigious
                institution for combat mages, warlocks and necromancers. The questionable antics of the college's studies have weighed heavily on the nation's
                criminal code, and unlike many nations Imzola had a very lax stance on the use of necromancy and other "crimes against the person". Importantly,
                however, the worst of these crimes were ratified in a special act, in which they are called "crimes most obscene".
            </p>
            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                The Duke of Imzola is the head of state, and also the head of Deftol's board of governors. Most
                day-to-day governance (including that of the entire country) is handled by said board of governors,
                and the Duke is largely a figurehead, although he retains some real power.
