            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                The nation of Azuria was founded by King Alford I, an exile from the nation of Imzola in the War of Blood.
                The nation was founded on the 7th Sun, 30th year of the Quicksilver Age of the Hierophant Era. Until the
                Grand Inquisition, the nation was a monarchy (headed by a King regent), however post-inquisition, the head
                of government is the head of the Church of Glory (also known as the Glorious Viceroy). The monarch still serves
                as ceremonial head of state, but their title has been reduced from King to Prince. Although other religions were
                outlawed in the Bladed Era, the laws were repealed in the Healing.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                Since the repeal of the laws, the Viceroy, in an effort to repair ill-will between the Azurian Kingdom and other
                religions, founded the Golden Chalice, a guild that spans across the Ixil Isles. The guild is dedicated to the
                preservation of faith and the protection of religious freedom (with the notable exception of the diabolic faith, which
                both the Azurian Kingdom and the Golden Chalice are dedicated to eradicating).
