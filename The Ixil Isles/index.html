                Throughout this campaign, players will have the opportunity to join various guilds and factions.
                Players may use downtime granted at the end of each session to advance their standing within their faction,
                in addition to completing quests during gameplay.
                Performing quests (and using downtime) will grant players <span class="fst-italic">guild crests</span> which can
                be used to purchase items, services and other benefits from their faction.
                Once a player has acquired a certain amount of guild crests, they may be eligible for a promotion-of-rank.
                Each player may only be a member of one faction at a time.
            </p>

                Promotions &amp; Ranks
            </h3>
            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                Each faction has its own set of ranks and promotion requirements. At lower ranks, players will only be
                required to collect a certain amount of guild crests to be eligible for a promotion. At higher ranks,
                however, players will be required to complete a quest or series of quests to be eligible for a promotion.
                Ranks will grant players access to unique items and benefits, as well as <span class="fst-italic">unique and innate</span>
                abilities.
            </p>
            <p class="ml-4 descriptor">
                Ranks are split into three categories: <span class="fst-italic">Associate</span>, <span class="fst-italic">Member</span> and
                <span class="fst-italic">Officer</span>. Progressing between categories requires a <span class="fst-italic">guild warrant</span>.
                Specifics on how to obtain a guild warrant will be detailed in the faction's page, and each subsequent <span class="fst-italic">warrant</span>
                will become increasingly difficult to obtain.
